This is a file demonstrating some of my quantum computing projects
In classical probability, outcomes follow straightforward rules. However, quantum probabilities exhibit wave-like behaviors, where interference patterns influence the likelihood of certain events.

The Quantum Shell Game simulates a classic guessing game where two peas are hidden under cups. Unlike the classical case, the peas here are quantum entangled:

Constructive interference increases the probability of finding peas in some positions.

Destructive interference reduces probabilities in others.

When one pea’s location is measured, the other pea’s state is instantaneously determined, illustrating entanglement.

This notebook implements this concept using Qiskit, showcasing quantum circuit creation, interference effects, and entanglement in a playful yet rigorous way.
